Henriks main research interests are judicial behavior, judicial dissent, and public opinion of courts and judges. More generally, he is interested in how fair procedures influences democratic legitimacy (as a part of the PROLEG-project). In addition, his reserach focuses on immigrants' participation in civil society (Centre for Research on Civil Society and Voluntary Sector), labor market participation among the chronically ill (PROCHRO), the effects of citizen panels on public perceptions of governance (DEMOVATE), and public perceptions of using liquid hydrogen to decarbonize maritime transport in Norway (Pilot-E project). His work mainly consists of quantitative observational studies as well as survey- and lab-experimental analyses.
